Add progress-driven part transitions. `createPartTransition` defines a named, status×active animation for a single element (any CSS property), and `<Part name="...">` runs it on that element anywhere inside a screen: an app/navigation bar child, body content, anything. Programmatic transitions play on the compositor with no React re-render, and the same definition follows the swipe-back drag inline. Register the transitions through the `Router`'s `partTransitions` prop. `createRawPartTransition` gives full per-variant control.
