Stabilize the public API at 1.0.0. The screen / transition / navigate / store surfaces (Router, Route, Screen, useNavigate, useStep, useScreen, useParams, createTransition, createDecorator, TaskManger, history & navigate stores) are now SemVer-major versioned — future breaking changes go through an explicit major bump and a migration note in this changelog. `@flemo/react-layout` stays in `0.x` until its motion-free FLIP migration lands.
