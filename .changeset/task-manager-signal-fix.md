Fix `TaskManager.resolveTask` rejecting `SIGNAL_PENDING` tasks. `emitSignal` delegates to `resolveTask`, so the previous status guard turned signal mode (`control.signal`) into a permanent no-op — any task parked on a signal would have hung indefinitely. Both `MANUAL_PENDING` and `SIGNAL_PENDING` now flow through the same resolution path.
