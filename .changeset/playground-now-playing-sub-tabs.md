Restructure the NowPlaying screen to drive Up Next / Lyrics through a bottom sheet instead of in-screen tabs — semantically a closer match for `useStep`, since the sheet's open state is URL/back-button reversible. The "Up Next" and "Lyrics" buttons each `pushStep` to open the sheet; the trailing swap chip inside the sheet uses `replaceStep` to flip contents in place without a close/reopen; the X button (or the system back button) `popStep`s the sheet shut. Album details are now shown inline by default — no toggle — so the screen leads with the artwork and the information you'd want at a glance. First playground surface that exercises every useStep verb in a flow that actually matches how a music app would model these affordances.
