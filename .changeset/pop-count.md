`useNavigate().pop`, `replace`, and `push` now take an optional distance — `{ skip }` (a number of screens) or `{ until }` (a route pattern) — to reach a screen below the top in a single transition. The skipped screens are removed without ever painting, so they never flash by.

All three reach the same target (`{ skip: n }` is the screen `n` below the top; `{ until }` is the nearest match) and differ only there: `pop` lands on it, `replace` replaces it (the target and everything above become the new screen), and `push` keeps it and stacks the new screen on top.

`{ skip }` clamps to the stack depth; an unmatched `until` is a no-op for `pop`/`replace` and a plain push for `push`. Plain `pop()` / `replace(path)` / `push(path)` are unchanged.
