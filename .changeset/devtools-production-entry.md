Resolve `@flemo/devtools` to an inert entry in production builds. The package now ships `development` / `production` export conditions, so a plain top-level import keeps the recorder and the panel out of a production bundle without the caller writing a dynamic-import guard — the guard was easy to forget, and forgetting it shipped the tool to every visitor silently. `@flemo/devtools/force` resolves to the real tool whatever the build mode, for a staging deploy or an e2e suite that must run against a production build.
